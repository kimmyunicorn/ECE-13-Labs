Message.C
MessageTest.C

This lab was the hardest lab, I didn't know if it was a good idea to work solo, or with a partner, but I decided that it would be less 
of a stress to do it solo. I like how the work was distributed for the individual student, so despite working solo or not it was the 
same workload. It was very difficult working with c programming and python and all the new concepts we had to learn. But I appreciate how 
we were given the diagrams for the state machines, it was extremely helpful. And I am very glad we got these resources.

A TA told me to start with message.C because message was the easiest files out of the four to make, they also said to do message first because 
agent works with message, or needs message to run.So I started with message.c, did message tests and then agent.c and agent test. 

Most of my test cases passed, so in total this lab was a success. But it was extremely hard and I am so glad that we got the extension.
