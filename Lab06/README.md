LAB 6 README
Kimberly Camanero (kcamaner@ucsc.edu)

Summary: The purpose of this lab was to get us used to board. This taught us many new things and new concepts. This lab showed us how to use the buttons and leds and how to time them.. I now feel more familiar with the PIC32 and the process of programming its components. Additionally, the concepts of interrupts and debouncing were essential and valuable topics covered in this lab.

Approach: I tried completing this lab in the order it was in the lab manual but I just couldn't get buttons to work. It kept failing to build and at last everything grayed out and a tutor did not know how to fix it. 
So I started with bounce timers, and made my way to the bounce switch and then adc. I obviously did led_lab6.c first to be able to use my functions.

Results: I would say that the manual was pretty unhelpful and unclear because I did not know why my code isn't working at the beginning and turns out I had to do the led functions at the beginning. But in the lab manual it explained that further into it which I think that page should've been the first page on the manual. I spent 5 days on this lab around 8 hours each a day trying to understand how to code a board because I have never been exposed to material like this. Tutors were helpful, but the concepts were hard to understand. I wish there was in person lab on Monday because I would have probably gotten buttons to work. But if we were to change something I’d say make the lab manual a lot clearer and easier to understand especially because students are just getting used to using the board, and for most kids its the first time being exposed to hardware. But it was cool seeing concepts from CSE12 being used in this lab. I liked when my code built and I was able to visually see what my code does in the board. I am more of a visual learner so seeing the mistakes of my code visually lets me know what I can fix in my code. And I’d rather code for a result and for me to be able to visually see something than just an output so i really liked that. Therefore I’d say it was a pretty worthwhile lab.
