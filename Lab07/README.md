Lab 7 README

Summary: Our task was to create an oven that had 3 modes. Bake, Toast, Broil. I think the important aspects were how to code the buttons as well as understand the concepts of state machines. Why I say the buttons were important is because a lot of functions or events were made depending on how long you press the same button for. 

Approach: I did read the lab manual first. I am glad we were provided with the button functions, that way we just call the functions. I first started out with my ISR functions (5hz & 10hz) given they were the easiest and simplest functions to code and understand. I then started working on my state machine, because the manual provided us with a diagram that was very easy to follow. Me personally I am a visual learner so seeing that and following the diagram was extremely helpful. I wish other labs had diagrams like that, it would’ve made it a lot easier to understand. After that, I worked on my main, given a tutor told me it was just three if statements. The hardest part was setting up the oven, and the display just because I was confused on the strings but now it’s easy to understand. My long press was not working for a while and turned out I had an extra while loop on my main, but once I got rid of that, it worked!

I think my lab ended up being a success, everything works as it should, I tried doing the extra credit but my brain was cooked with this. I also started a bit last minute given the strike and how there was no in person lab, I was not motivated to start and didn't know where or how. I worked on it for a total of 4 days, around 6-8 hours each. But it was worth it because it all works. It was a worthwhile lab, this is my favorite lab out of all of them in this class. I think the points distribution is fair.
