SelectionSort(); 238.4983ms
InsertionSort(): 1.0147 s

Selection sort is usually faster at sorting a randomized list, but insertion sort works better when the list is partially sorted. This is what I expected.


Summary
The lab taught us about memory management and sorting techniques using linked lists. The main things I learned were how linked lists work and the speed differences between sorting methods. It was also important to understand how to assign and free up memory. Also for some reason getting the time was so hard for me, but at least I know of a feature in MPLAB now, which I think is really cool. 

APPROACH
I saw that the sort.c was only worth 2 points so I decided to leave that for last. I decided to work on my functions first on linkedlist.c like create a list, and then create after and the functions that followed it. I then started on the linked test test cases. I tested each of the functions, mostly using the same format, basically just using if else statements. Once that was all completed I decided to work on sort, which even though it was only two functions it still took me a while, and awhile to understand as well. The errors I was getting where errors with my remove function, my code isn't going inside the remove function. Which is why as you can see in the comments I did a lot of printf statements to see what was wrong with my code. It ended up being the free command. I commented it out and once that was commented out it worked. I was having a hard time with the test cases as well, I wished we had a format like we did with the stacks, it was very helpful but this time we had nothing so it was really challenging starting the test file for the linked lists. I approached the lab the lab manual said to do so, and I found that really helpful. I am glad we got provided with that as well on the code on how to do the sort functions. 

Results
I spent two days working on this lab I would say around 5 hours day 1 and 8 hours the second day. It was hard, Hardest lab so far. I shouldn't have procrastinated. The results were disappointing because I thought it would be in order “Just the two of us” but I guess I added them weirdly in my test cases so it wasn't what I was expecting. I didn't like the stopwatch, the manual was confusing, I don't usually build on MPLAB, I use terminals so it was something new for me. The points seem fair to me, and I think this was a worthwhile lab. Especially with the times it gives us a little insight on data structures!
